### For next code up

If you are new to Ethereum. Makoto recommends trying out a framework called [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com). He created a quick [tutorial site](https://github.com/makoto/london-ethereum-codeup/blob/master/tutorials/truffle.md). so you can go through and ask any questions.
