## Topics we want to talk about

- Makoto from [Kickback](http://kickback.events) wants to talk about new feature which should be implemented by the meetup. If I am comfortable with the code quality, I may through some bug bounty ETH/DAI
- Lev from [Dapphub](https://dapphub.com/) will do quick demo of [klab](https://github.com/dapphub/klab) for formal verification.
- Makoto will probably go through the hack he did with Will Harborne , https://devpost.com/software/offset-dai
