# Codeup #11 Summary

Due to middle of summer vacation there were least number of participants (4). 
However, small participants enabled us to actually write some code of [blockparty](https://github.com/makoto/blockparty), meetup management tool on blockchain with a twist.
This is the first time we used blockparty to track our participants. Open [CodeUp#11 blockpary](http://blockparty.io.codeupv11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) on Mist pointing to testnet to see who earned and who lost their deposit.

We also talked about whether there are any code coverage tools. Though there isn't none of these we know of, there is actually [Solidity lint tool](https://github.com/weifund/solint).
