# CodeUp #9 summary 

## The ETC

The first discussion was what ETC means for ETH holders. One thing which I did not know was that every ETH holders prior to Hard fork has equivalent amount of ETC and the ETC can be at the risk of so called replay attack.
You can find out your ETC balance at http://gastracker.io/. More links below
